# cppAudioFX
C++ implementation of audio effects, mainly for processing guitar signal. The implementation is tested in JUCE, but the classes can be used in any C++ - related framework, e.g. Bela.


A possible roadmap:
1) Monophonic delay (done).
2) Distortion (check https://github.com/marcoalkema/cpp-guitar_effects/blob/master/distortion.cpp).
3) Stereo delay.
4) Low-pass filter.
5) Add low-pass filter to delays.
6) Oscillator (as an LFO).
7) Tremolo.
8) Chorus.
9) Octave down / up.
10) High-pass filter.
11) Band-pass filter.
12) Wah.
13) Harmonics synth.
